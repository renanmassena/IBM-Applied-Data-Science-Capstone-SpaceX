# IBM-Applied-Data-Science-Capstone-SpaceX
This capstone project course I will work with real data sets. I will assume the role of a Data Scientist working for a startup company that intends to compete with SpaceX, and in the process I will follow Data Science methodology involving data collection, data discussion, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, model development, model evaluation, and reporting its results to stakeholders.
I am in charge of predicting whether the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully.  SpaceX advertises the Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website at a cost of $62 million; other vendors cost over $165 million each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage.
Therefore, if I can accurately predict the probability of a successful launch of the first stage of the rocket, it is possible to determine the cost of a launch. With the help of my findings and Data Science models, the competing startup you were hired by can make more informed bids against SpaceX for a rocket launch.
This course is the final course in IBM's Professional Data Science Certificate, as well as the Applied Data Science Course with Python Specialization.
